## Code of Conduct <span id="code-of-conduct">

This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to
distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and
goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, in
everything you do.

1. **Be considerate**

    Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work
    of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we
    should consider them when making decisions.

2. **Be respectful**

    Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
    conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic
    fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A team
    where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

3. **Take responsibility for our words and our actions**

    We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
    someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
    and work to right the wrong. A good place to start is by apologizing
    privately and then, if the situation calls for it, publicly.

    ***We never purposely ignore calls or messages from a team mate. This is an unforgivable act that mars trust beyond repair.***

4. **Be collaborative**

    What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts. Collaboration between
    teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to
    be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to
    understand the whole.

    Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
    Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
    possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free
    software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently
    and involve interested parties as early as possible.

5. **Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus**

    Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
    persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.
    We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements
    constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to leaders to
    arbitrate and provide clarity and direction. More often, we simply call a
    vote.

6. **Ask for help when unsure**

    Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early
    avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be
    directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive
    and helpful.

7. **Step down considerately**

    When somebody leaves the project, we ask that they do so in a way that
    minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving
    and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left
    off.
