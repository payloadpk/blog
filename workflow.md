Welcome to Team Payload.
========================
This document should introduce you to the general Payload workflow and help you
get started as quickly as possible. Even if you hate reading, scan through this
document a few times because everyone's done it.

## Team Tools <span id="team-tools"/>
We usually work with:

1. Slack
2. Github
3. Google Docs
4. Twitter
5. Email*
6. Hangouts* or Skype*
7. Phones

\* RARELY

**Meetings waste time.** We believe that meetings pull you from doing actual
work in order to talk about doing work. That is why we usually talk on chat,
and rarely use Skype.

### Slack <span id="slack">

All team comms happen on our [slack.](https://payload.slack.com) The
slack domain is `payload.slack.com`, and you can use your `@payload.pk` email
address to sign up! Here are a few pointers on how to use slack:

1. **Fill out your profile**

    Add a picture, your skype name, and phone number details. You can always
    change it later.

2. **#Channels** are where we discuss things. The names are self evident, but if
    you're confused either read the channel's purpose, or **ask.**

    >**gilani:** what're the #random and #music channel?  
    >**sulaiman:** anything non-work related is #random, and #music where we share
    >our jams, bro!

3. **@mention** people when you want to talk to them.

    >**gilani:** **@paybot**: thanks  
    >**paybot:** don't mention it

4. **Paybot** is our robot, he helps us automate things, if you'd like, you can
    add features or play around with his code
    [here.](https://github.com/payloadpk/paybot) If you run into a repetitive
    task, automate it through Paybot.

5. **Discuss everything on chat.** Even if you're in the same room because a
    transcript is helpful, and @paybot is a pretty helpful googler.

6. **Chat is asynchronous.** Asynchronous communication means you can step out
    for lunch and catch up on transcripts when you get back. You can ask someone
    a question in-chat and not worry about bothering them since she'll get back
    to you when they're available.

### Github <span id="github">

All our code goes on our [Github.](https://github.com/payloadpk) We encourage
pull requests and issues on any of our projects, and prefer to open source
things as we go. Unless it's extremely sensitive code, GPL, or AGPL it. If you're
unsure, **ask.**

1. **Fill out your profile**
    Add a picture, maybe a bio, look nice!
2. **Get a Git primer** [here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) if you need it.
3. **Use a strong SSH key** instead of your password to push commits
4. **Use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)** for collaborative coding

### Google Docs <span id="google-docs">

We use Google Docs because it helps collaborate. Make sure people with links can
edit documents when you share them so that anyone can help, even later.

### Twitter <span id="twitter">

If someone does something nice, give them a shout out on Twitter. It may not
look like much, but it means a lot and
[#TeamPayload loves Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamPayload).

### Email <span id="email">

We're a small team, and we rarely use email to talk to each other, but in almost
every email we send, we CC the team with `team@payload.pk`. Just to keep
everyone in the loop about everything that happens.

### Google Hangouts and Skype <span id="google-hangouts-and-skype">

In the rare event that we can't meet up and need to talk over something, we use
Google Hangouts because Skype has really bad Linux support. But if **@gilani**
isn't around, use Skype if you want.

### Phones <span id="phones">

If there's an emergency, everyone's phone numbers are one their slack profiles.

***Never purposely ignore a team mate's phone call. This is unforgivable.***

### Markdown <span id="markdown">

Word creates formatting issues, HTML is tedious. Use Markdown.
[Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/) makes it easy if you don't have Atom.

### Atom <span id="atom">

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is the best text editor ever. If you go the Atom route, install these
packages to make your life easier:

1. Code:
  * [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter): and then extend it [here](http://atomlinter.github.io/)
  * [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify): cleaner code.
  * [uglify](https://atom.io/packages/uglify): ugly but computationally efficient code.
2. Markdown helpers:
  * [markdown-writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer): easy writing.
  * [tidy-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/tidy-markdown): cleaner markdown
3. Tweaks:
  * [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap): a minimap of the code on the right
  * [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode): for vim-like control
4. Git:
  * [merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts): highlights merge conflicts
  * [git-plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus): git stuff without the terminal.

## How we work <span id="how we work">

We measure work by effort, not by hours. We work whenever we can.

Creative work:

1. Think it in the morning
2. Build it in the afternoon.

Responsibilities:

1. Finish a bit of your TODO
2. Gather feedback on existing projects
3. Add items on your TODO
5. Repeat

Most importantly, when you want it, **ask for help.** However, understand by
doing that you'll be asking someone to focus on your work instead of theirs.
As a general rule, ask for help a little bit at a time.

We do regular informal performance reviews. Nothing to worry about, and we'll
share our concerns if we think you're shirking.
